## Features

- RSA encryption/decryption of notes
- Secure storage in SQLite database
- Simple command-line interface

---

## How It Works

### Encryption Process
- Uses RSA algorithm for encryption
- Generates new key pair for each session
- Stores only encrypted data in database

### Database Storage
- SQLite database for persistence
- Stores encrypted notes with timestamps
- No original text is saved

### Security Notes
- Keys are generated fresh each session
- Original text is never stored in database
- Uses SQLite with parameterized queries for safety
